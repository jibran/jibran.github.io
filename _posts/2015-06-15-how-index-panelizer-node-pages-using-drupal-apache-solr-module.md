title: How to index panelizer node pages using Drupal Apache Solr module
excerpt: Apache Solr Search is a great module for integrating your Drupal site with the powerful Apache Solr search tool. Out of the box it can index nodes and their fields, but Panelizer pages won't be indexed. In this post I show how you can get around this by indexing the rendered HTML of a panelizer node page.
