This week I was quite busy with the work so didn't get a chance to contribute a lot.

## Bug Smash Initiative

Griffyn and Lee pinged me on Monday to run bug smash fortnightly meeting. I haven't run one in a while. I like running
the meetings, so I said yes even though I knew my Tuesday was going to be busy, and it was. I was performing a technical
audit for a client site at work with a colleague, so I was on call all day. On Monday, I set up a couple of slack
reminders for me. Griffyn graciously shared the templates beforehand for reminder message and meeting agenda all I
had to do was copy and paste those messages in [#bug-smash][bug-smash]{:target="_blank"}. I did copy and paste those
messages, but they were templates, and I forgot to update dates and timings ðŸ˜€. Lee pointed that out, and I
edited them after posting in [#bug-smash][bug-smash]{:target="_blank"}

Meeting started at 3 PM AEST and I took half an hour break from the call and started the meeting. To my surprise
[@dww][dww] was also concerned about lack of bug smash triage sessions, so I ended up pointing him towards last week
triage threads. It is nice to see that I was not the only one concerned about it. After posting all the topics I set up
a 4 PM reminder and went back to join the work call. At four, I concluded the meeting and caught up on all the threads
afterwards.

Thank you [@larowlan][larowlan]{:target="_blank"} and [@griffynh][griffynh]{:target="_blank"} for helping me run the
bug smash meeting. If you are interested in running the meeting then feel free to ping any of us in Slack we love to
have more people running the meetings.
