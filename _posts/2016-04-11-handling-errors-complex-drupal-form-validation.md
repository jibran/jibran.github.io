title: Handling Errors in Complex Drupal Form Validation
excerpt: Recently, I have been working on a site with a big multi-step form that is using a lot of custom form elements, custom auto-completes, custom form api states and ajax based sub-forms. It is all built using Drupal form api. The best thing about this form is that all the fields and sub-forms map to a data model.
