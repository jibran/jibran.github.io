Let's try something new...

When I set the site up, I though what would be a good idea for daily updates? I came to conclusion, how about weekly
Drupal contribution updates. It will be challenging, every Saturday you have to think back what you have contributed,
but let's go with it. üôÇ

## Bug Smash Initiative

This week was interesting, at the start of the week I was thinking that we, the bug-smashers[^1], hadn't been doing
group triage sessions[^2], lately. So, I left a reminder about the group triage around three hours before the session,
saying I'd be around to participate in group triage session. We started a thread from that message and discussed a
bunch of issues.

I had so much fun working with fellow bug-smashers that next day I left another message, and we started another thread
form it. üòÅ

Thanks to fellow Drupal community members for helping with group triage:

There is a saying in Urdu language: 
<div dir="rtl">
ŸÇÿ∑ÿ±€Å ŸÇÿ∑ÿ±€Å ÿØÿ±€åÿß ÿ®ŸÜÿ™ÿß €Å€í
</div>

Translation: Little drops of water make a mighty ocean

Meaning: Every bit helps

## Coding contributions

As a coding contribution, I only re-rolled one patch core patch [Upgrade tests to HTML5][2441373-71]{:target="_blank"}
and found a typo in shiny new [drupal once npm package][drupal-once]{:target="_blank"}
[Fix a typo in Using a single element Example][3199794]{:target="_blank"} but, I did review a few issues this week.
